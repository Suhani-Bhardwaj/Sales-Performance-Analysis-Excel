## Key Insights
1. **Category Performance**: Furniture contributes the highest overall sales among all categories, but high sales do not always translate into high profitability, indicating the need to monitor cost structures and pricing strategies.
2. **Regional Performance**: California has the highest sales and generates the maximum profit, suggesting targeted expansion and marketing in this region could maximize revenue.
3. **Product-Level Profitability**: Copiers and Machines generate the lowest profit, indicating potential pricing or cost issues that need review.
4. **Seasonal Trends**: Sales peak during November–December, highlighting opportunities for targeted campaigns and inventory planning.
